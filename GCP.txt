- Udemy : Google Professional Cloud Architect Certification !
  * Skip : 1 - 8 
- Google cloud platform is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that goolge uses internally for its end users products such
  as Google serach and Youtube.
- Regions : Independent geographic areas that consists of zones.Main purpose is to host applications near to your users to reduce latency, and availability,durability
- Zones : Physical locations inside regions.It provides geo redundancy.Used mainly for high availability inside region.
- GCP Services  : 
1) Compute : Compute Engine, App Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Functions
2) Storage : Datastore, Storage, Bigtable, SQL, Spanner
3) Networking : VPC Network, Network Services, Interconnect
4) Identity & Security : 
5) BigData : 
6) Machine Learning : 
- GCP Interfaces : 
  1) GCP Console (UI) / Mobile App
  2) Command line interface (Cloud Shell / Cloud SDK ): gcloud, bg, gsutil,kubectl etc
  3) API/Client libraries : IDE,eidtor,postman,curl etc
- GCP Project :  To track resource and quote usage.
  * Enable billing.Manage permissions and credientials. Enbale service and APIs.
  * Project use three identifying attributes : Project name,Project number, Project ID
  * Can be managed from cloud console or cloud resource manager API
- GCP Resources : 1) Zonal : VM instaces, VM discs etc 2) Regional : Static IP address 3) Global : Network,Disk images,Snapshots,Networks 

1) Compute Services : 
	* Virtal Machine : Server in cloud with auto scaling ,full control of OS.
	* Code & Container : Container orchestration,Deploy code.In build auto scaling and load balancing.
	* Serverless : No Ops env.Mostly you don't want to manage any H/W resources.
1.1) Compute Engine : IaaS 
	* Compute Engine : Row server.After choosing OS and desired configuration, We need to install necessary software to use it as per or requirement.eg as an 
	  application server.
	* Scalable, high-performance virtual machines (which are running in google's inovative data centers and world wide fiber network)
	* OS dependent, Full control on H/W & N/W , OS Level changes
	* Commands : 
	  1) gcloud compute zones list		OR		gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1  
	  2) gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-c
	  3) gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-1"
	  4) gcloud compute instances list
1.2) App Engine : PaaS
	* Extention of Compute Engine.Generally used for web server configration.We don't have to install required software manually.
	* A flexible zero ops platform.
	* Just write code, No Ops dependencies , Scalable , Traffic splitting  
1.3) Container(Kubernetes) Engine : PaaS
    * Deploy,manage and scale containerized applications
	* No OS dependencies, Scalable production load
	* Kubernetes is container orchestration platform.
	* features : 
	  * Horizonatal scaling
	  * Self healing 
	  * Load balancing & service discovery 
	  * Automated roll outs & Roll backs
	  * Storage orchestration
	  * Bach execution
	  * Configuration management
	* Kubernetes Architecture : 
	  1) Kubernetes master node : 
	     1) API Server : 
		    *  provides all the operation on cluster using the API.
		 2) Scheduler : 
			* service in master responsible for distributing the workload.
			* responsible for workload utilization and allocating pod to available/new nodes.
		 3) etcd : 
		    * distributed key value store.
			* It stores the configuration information which can be used by each of the nodes in the cluster.
			* It is accessible only by Kubernetes API server as it may have some sensitive information.
		 4) Controller manager : 
		    * responsible for most of the collectors that regulates the state of cluster and performs a task.
			* responsible for collecting and sending information to API server
			* replication controller, endpoint controller, namespace controller, and service account controller.
	  2) Kubernetes node (slave node) : 
         1) kube-proxy : 
		    * helps in making services available to the external host.
			* helps in forwarding the request to correct containers and is capable of performing primitive load balancing.
			* manages pods on node, volumes, secrets, creating new containers’ health checkup.
         2) Docker engine : 
         3) kubelet : 
		    * communicates with the master component to receive commands and work.
			* interacts with etcd store to read configuration details and write values
			* manages network rules, port forwarding
         4) Pod (Docker containers , Volume , IP Address) : 
		    * node can have multiple pods and pod can have multiple containers. 
			* Containers of same Pod shares IP Address.
	* Deployment : 
	  * represent a set of multiple, identical Pods with no unique identities.
	  * Deployment runs multiple replicas of your application and automatically replaces any instances that fail or become unresponsive.
	  * Deployments are managed by the Kubernetes Deployment controller.
	  * Deployments use a Pod template, which contains a specification for its Pods which determines how each Pod should look like: what applications should run inside
	    its containers, which volumes the Pods should mount, its labels, and more.
	* Service : 
	  * service is a grouping of pods that are running on the cluster.
	  * An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.
	  * Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.
	* Kubernetes Deployment Builder : https://static.brandonpotter.com/kubernetes/DeploymentBuilder.html	
	* Deployment strategis : 
      1) Recreate : 
	  2) Rolling Update (default) : 
	     * without any downtime. 
		 * new pods will be created and once new pods are up and running and ready to be served than old pods will be destroyed
	  3) BlueGreen : 
	     * kubectl apply -f kube-blue-v1.yml			// current deployment and service object (v1 : blue)
		 * kubectl apply -f kube-green-v2.yml			// new deployment and service object (v2 : green)
		 * kubectl apply -f kube-blue-v2.yml			// new deployment and service object (v2 : blue). old blue service will now point to v2 deployment obj.
		 * kubectl delete deployment.apps/spring-boot-example-v1 service/spring-boot-example-green		// delete old v1 deployment and green v2 service obj
	  4) Canary : 
    * commands :  
      1) mvn compile com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:build -Dimage=gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/spring-boot-example:v1 		// gcr.io/my-first-project-254606/spring-boot-example:v1
	  2) gcloud container clusters create cluster-name --zone us-central1-a --num-nodes 2
	  3) gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster-1 --zone us-central1-a		// to login into kubernetes cluster
	  4) kubectl get pods
	  5) kubectl get deployments
	  6) kubectl get services
	  7) kubectl get all
	  8) docker run -ti --rm -p 8080:8080 gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/spring-boot-example:v1 // to run container locally inside kbernates 
	  9) kubectl run spring-boot-example --image=gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/spring-boot-example:v1 --port=8080	// 1st Approach to create deployment and service object
	     kubectl expose deployment spring-boot-example --type=LoadBalancer	
	 10) kubectl apply -f deployment.yml		// 2nd Approach to create/update deployment and service object
	     kubectl apply -f service.yml
	 11) kubectl get svc -w
	 12) kubectl scale deployment spring-boot-example --replicas=3
	 13) kubectl autoscale deployment spring-boot-example --min=10 --max=15 --cpu=80
	 14) kubectl log pod-name
	 15) kubectl delete deployment-name/service-name
1.4) Cloud Functions : SaaS
	* Event based serverless environment to build and connect cloud services.
	* Same as App Engine  but you do not host an application. Used for backend processing.

2) Storage Services : 
2.1) Datastore :
     * to store NoSQL (unstructured) kind of data.  
2.2) Bigtable : 
     * to store NoSQL (unstructured) kind of data.Used with hadoop (Bigdata application).  	 
2.3) Storage : 
     * File System storage service. Can be used to store application file in storage service.
	 * It store objects in buckets.
	 * commands : 
	   * gsutil mb -l US gs://BUCKET_NAME
	   * gsutil cp gs://01_storage_bucket/1.txt gs://02_storage_bucket
	   * gsutil ls gs://01_storage_bucket
2.4) SQL :  
     * to store structured data. SQL can not be scaled horizonally.
2.5) Spanner : 
     * same as SQL but  it can be scaled horizonally.
	 
- VPC Network : Virtual private cloud. To create an network where two application deployed on cloud can talk with each other.
- Network Services : Load balancing, Cloud DNS, Cloud CDN
- Interconnect : 

- Commands
gcloud init
gcloud sql connect mysql-instance1 --user=root
