- React is an open source javascript library for building user interfaces (UI). Not a framework. Focus on UI. Rich echosystem.React is declarative.Devloped by Facebook.
- Virtual DOM is an abstract, lightweight copy of DOM. It can be changed as and when we want and then can be saved to the real DOM.
- React has a Component based architecture.Components describe a part of the user interface.They are reusable and can be nested inside other components.
  e.g Root(App) component, Header, Side Nav, Main Content, Footer
- Component Types : 
  1) Stateless functional component : Javascript functions. optionally receives object of properties (props) and return HTML (JSX)
	function Welcome(props){
		return <h1>Hello {props.name} </h1>;
	}
  2) Statefull class component : Class extending Component class.optionally receives object of properties (props) and return HTML (JSX). Can also maintain 
     private internal state. e.g  
     export default class Welcome extends React.component{		// OR React.createClass({})
		render(){
			return <h1>Hello {props.name} </h1>;
		}
	}
			Functional 								Class
  * Simple functions					* More feature rich
  * Absence of 'this' keyword			* Maintain their own private data - state
  * Soltion withot using state			* Complex UI logic
  * Mainly responsible for the UI		* Provide lifecycle hooks
  * Stateless/Dumb/Presentational		* Stateful/Smart/Container
- When you create react app, it will automatically configure Development server, Webpack (for bundling files) , Babel (for compiling JS code)
- JSX (Javascript XML) - Extention to the javascript language syntax.It help us write XML like code for elements and components.
- JSX tags have tag name,attributes and children.JSX is not necessary to write React applications.However,it makes your react code simpler and elegant.
- JSX ultimately traspiles to pure Javascript which is understood by the browsers.Faster because it performs optimization while compiling code to JavaScript.
  Type-safe and most of the errors can be caught during compilation. e.g 
  return ( <div id="greetDiv"><h1>Hello Vishal<h1></div>); // with JSX
  return React.createElement("div" , {id : "greetDiv"} , React.createElement("h1",null,"Hello Vishal")); // without JSX
- JSX syntax diffrence : 
  1) class -> className 2) for -> htmlFor 3) onclick -> onClick 4) tabindex -> tabIndex
				props										state
  * props get passed to the componet		* state is managed within the component
  * Function parameters						* Variable declared in the function body
  * props are immutable						* state can be changed
  * props - FC , this.props - CC			* useState Hook - FC , this.state - CC
- setState method considerations : 
  1) Always make use of setState method and never modify the state directly.
  2) Code has to be executed after the state has been updated ? Place the code in the call back function which is the second arg to the setState method
  3) When yo have to update the state based on the the previous state value, pass in a function as an arg instead of  the regular object.
- Object destructuring   : const { firstName,lastName } = this.props;
- Event Handling in FC : <button onClick={clickHandler}>FunctionClick</button>  (Define function inside {}. Don't invoke it)
- Event Handling in CC : <button onClick={this.clickHandler}>ClassClick</button> (without se of this inside clickHandler method)
- Binding event handler in CC to use this keyeord inside event handler
  1) <button onClick={this.clickHandler.bind(this)}>ClassClick</button>				// Inline using  bind method
  2) <button onClick={() => this.clickHandler()} > EventBind - Click</button>		// using arrow fn
  3) constructor() { this.clickHandler = this.clickHandler.bind(this); }			// Inside constructor
  4) clickHandler = () => {  console.log(this); };									// by declaring event handler using arrow fn
- Method as props : to update parent from child component. yo can pass parameter from child to parent also. e.g 
  <ChildComponent greetHandler={this.greetParent} />						 // Inside parent comp
  greetParent(childName) { alert(`Hello from ${childName}`); }
  <button onClick={() => props.greetHandler("child")}>Greet Parent</button>  // Inside child comp
- Conditional rendernig : 
  1) using if/else : However, it don't work inside JSX.
  2) Element variablles : 
  3) Ternary conditional operation (?) : can be used inside JSX.
  4) Short circuit operator : 
- In list rendering e.g { persons.map(p => <Person key={p.id} person={p} /> ) } :
  * "key" is a special string attribute you need to include when creating list of elements.
  * keys give the elements a stable identity.
  * keys help React identify which items have changed,are added,or are removed.
  * Help in efficient update of the user interface.
  * use index as key only if 1) the items in your list do not have a unique id. 2) list is a static list and will not change. 3) The list will never be reordered or filtered.
- Styling React componet : 
  1) CSS stylesheets 
  2) Inline styling 
  3) CSS module : availabe with react-scripts version 2 or higher. filename must suffix with .module.css
  4) CSS in JS libaries (Styled components)
- Lifecycle Methods: 
1) Mounting :  
- When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM. 
  1) constructor(props) : 
     * special function that will get called whenever a new component is created
	 * Used for initializing state and binding the event handlers
	 * Do not cause side effects Ex. HTTP requests
	 * super(props) and Can directlty overwrite this.state
  2) static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)  
     * rarely used and can be used when the state of component depends on changes in props over time
	 * Set the state. Do not cause side effects Ex. HTTP requests
  3) render()							
     * Only required method. Read props & state and return JSX 
	 * Don't change state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls 
	 * Children component lifecycle methods are also executed
  4) componentDidMount () 
     * Invoked only once.Invoked immediately after a component and all its children components have been rendered to the DOM.
	 * Cause side effects. Ex. Interact with the DOM or perform any ajax calls to load data
2) Updating : 
- When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state.
  1) static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)  
  2) shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps,nextState)
     * rarely used and Dictate if the component should re-render or not.
	 * Peformance optimization. Do not cause side effects Ex. HTTP requests or Calling the setState method
  3) render()
  4) getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps,prevState)
     * rarely used and called right before the changes from the virtual DOM are to be reflected in the DOM
	 * Capture some information from the DOM.
	 * Method will either return null or return value.Returned value will be passed as the third parameter to the next method
  5) componentDidUpdate(prevProps,prevState,snapshot)
     * Invoked only once..Called after the render is finished in the re-render cycles.
	 * Cause side effects. Ex. perform any ajax calls to load data
3) Unmounting : 
- When a component is being removed from the DOM. 
  1) componentWillUnmount()
     * Method is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed.
	 * You can perform some cleanup task like cancelling any network requests,removing event handlers,cancelling any subscriptions and also invalidating timers.
	 * Do not call the setState method.
4) Error Handling : 
- When there is an error during rendedring,in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component
  1) static getDerivedStateFromError(error)
  2) componentDidCatch(error,info)
- React.Fragment let's you group list of children elments without adding extra node to the DOM. Only "key" attribute can be passed inside React.Fragment element.
  shortcut of React.Fragment : <> Content </> However key can't be passed with this approach
- Regular component does not implement the shouldComponentpdate method.It always return true by default.								 
- Pure component (Works with class component) : 
  * Pure component implements shouldComponentpdate lifecycle method by performing a shallow comparison on the props and state of the component.															
  * If there is no differnce, the component is not re-rendered - Performance boost.
  * It is good idea to ensure that all the children components are also pure to avoid unexpected behaviour.
  * never muted the state.Always return a new object that reflects the new state. 
- Shallow comparison (SC) : 1) Primitive types : a (SC) b returns true if a and b have the same value and are of the same type
  2) Complex types : a (SC) b returns true if a and b reference the exact same object.	
- React.memo(funcComp) introduced in react version 16.6.0 is used to make function compoment as pure component. (To avoid re-rendering if there is no diffrence)
- Refs (React.createRef()) is used to access DOM nodes directly within React. refs attribute can not attach to fn component.
- React.forwardRef is used to forward ref to the child fn component.
- React Portals provides way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component (other than root element node).
  It used mainly to deal with parent component's CSS when it' child component is modal , popup or tooltip.
  e.g  return ReactDOM.createPortal( <h1>PortalDemo</h1> , document.getElementById("portal-root") );
- Error Boundary : 
  * Error Boundaries are React components that catch Javascript error in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fall-back UI.
  * class component becomes an Error Boundary by defining either one or both of the lifecycle methods static getDerivedStateFromError(error) or
    componentDidCatch(error,info).The static method getDerivedStateFromError is used to render a fallback UI after an error is thrown and the componentDidCatch 
    method is used to log the error information.
  * The placement of Error Boundary also matters as it controls if the entire app should have the fall-back UI or just the component causing the problem.
  * Provide a way to gracefully handle error in application code.
- Higer order component pattern : is a pattern where a function takes a component as an argument and return a new enhanced component. e.g 
  const EnhancedComponent = higerOrderComponent(originalComponent) ; It is used to share common functionality between components.
- Render props pattern : refers to a technique for "sharing code" between react components using "prop whose value is a function".
- Context provides way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
  1) Create the Context. (using React.createContext() ) 
  2) Provide a context value. (using Provider component e.g <UserProvider value="Vishal"> <ComponentC /></UserProvider> )
  3) Consume the context value (using Consumer component e.g <UserConsumer>{ (username) => { return <div>Hello {username}</div>;} }</UserConsumer> )
---------- React Hooks  ----------
- Hooks are new feature addition in React version 16.8 which allow you to use React features without having to write a class. e.g state of a component
- Hooks don't work inside classes.
- Hooks avoid the whole confusion with 'this' keyword. Allow you to reuse stateful logic.Organize the logic inside a component into reusable isolated units.
- Only call Hooks at the Top level : Don't call Hooks inside loops,conditions,or nested functions
- Only call Hooks from React functions (React functional component): Don't call it from any regular javascript function
1) useState() Hook : 
  * useState hook lets you add state to functional components
  * In classes, the state is always an object. With the useState hook, the state doesn't have to be an object (It can be normal variable or object or array)
  * useState hook returns an array with 2 elements. The first element is the current value of the state, and  the second element is a state setter function.
  * If new state value depends on the previous state value, you can pass a function to the setter function.
  * When dealing with objects or arrays,always make sure to spread your state variable and then call the setter function.
- Difference : setState() merge and update the object state automatically while useState() Hooks setter function does not merge and update the object state 
  automatically. You have to do it manually (using ES6 spread operator ...) e.g  
  <input type="text" value={name.firstName} onChange={e => setName({ ...name, firstName: e.target.value })} />
2) useEffect Hook : 
- The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in functional components.
- It is a close replacement for componentDidMount,componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount lifecycle methods.
- You can logically group related side effects in useEffect hook and can also define muliple useEffects.
3) useContext Hook : const employee = useContext(EmployeeContext)
4) useReducer Hook : 
- useReducer hook is used for state management.It is an alternative to useState. useState is built using useReducer.
- useReducer is related to reducer functions. useReducer(reducer,initialState) and reducer(currentState,action)
		Scenario							useState 						useReducer
  Type of state							Number,String,Boolean			Object or Array
  Number of state transitions			One or Two						Too Many
  Related state transition?				No								Yes
  Business logic						No business logic				Complex business logic
  Local vs Global						Local							Global
5) useCallback Hook :
- useCallback is a hook that will return a memorized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.
- It is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.
6) useMemo Hook :
- Difference : useCallback caches the provided function instance itself where as useMemo invokes provided function and caches its result.
7) useRef Hook :  
- useRef hook makes it possible to access DOM nodes directly within functional components.
8) Custom Hook : 
- A Custom hook is basically a Javascript function whose name starts with "use".
- A Custom hook can also call other hooks if required.
- It is used to share logic - Alternative to HOCs and Render Props 
---------- Redux ----------
- Redux is predicatable state container for Javascript apps. Can be used with React, Angular Vue or Vanila Javascript.
- Redux stores the state of your application.State of an app is the state represented by all the individual components of that app.
- Redux will store and manage the application state.
- In Redux, all state transitions are explicit and it is possible to keep track of them.
- Three core concept in Redux : 
1) Store : holds the state of your application
   * Allows access to state via getState()
   * Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action) 
   * Registers listeners via subscribe(listener)
   * Handles unregistering of listeners via function returned by subscribe(listener) 
2) Action : describes the changes in the state of the application. 
   * The only way your application can interact with the store.
   * Carry some information from your app to the redux store. 
   * Plain javaxript object.
   * Have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed
   * The type property is tyhpically is defined as string constants.
3) Reducer : Carries out the state trasition depending on the action
   * Specify how the app's state changes in response to actions sent to the store
   * Function that accepts state and action as args, and returns the next state of the app. (prevState, action) => newState e.g
	 const reducer = (state,action) => {
		switch(action.type) {
			case BUY_CAKE : 
				return { numberOfCakes : state.numberOfCakes - 1 } 
		}
    }
- Three Principles : 
1) The state of your application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
-  Maintain our application state in single object which would be managed by the Redux store. e.g for Cake Shop App , { numberOfCakes : 10 }
2) The only way to change the state is to dispatch (emit) an action,an object describing what happened.
-  To update the state of your app, you need to let Redux know about that with an action. Not allowed to directly update the state object. e.g 
   Let the shopkeeper (reducer) know about our action - BUY_CAKE. { type : BUY_CAKE }
3) To specify how the state tree is trasformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
- Middleware is the suggested way to extend Redux with custom functionality.
  * Provides a third-party extention oint between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer
  * Use middleware for logging,crash reporting,performing asynchronous tasks etc  
- redux-thunk Middleware is used to define async action creators
